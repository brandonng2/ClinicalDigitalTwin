# ClinicalDigitalTwin

A clean, modular pipeline for preprocessing MIMIC-IV data (Hospital, ICU, ED, and ECG) for clinical digital twin modeling.  
**Note:** Temporal preprocessing is still in progress.

## Project Overview

This repository provides an end-to-end framework for preparing integrated MIMIC-IV datasets for clinical digital twin modeling. It combines data from:

- **MIMIC-IV:** Core hospital and ICU data including admissions, diagnoses, procedures, and patient demographics
- **MIMIC-IV-ED:** Emergency department visits and diagnoses
- **MIMIC-IV-ECG:** Electrocardiogram recordings and measurements

The pipeline supports both static (column-based) and temporal (row-based) preprocessing, enabling streamlined integration for downstream analyses and predictive modeling. **This project specifically focuses on the cohort of patients who have ECG records.**

## Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.8 or higher
- **PhysioNet Access:** Credentialed access to all MIMIC-IV datasets
- **Required Training:** CITI "Data or Specimens Only Research" certification
- **Google BigQuery:** Optional but recommended for efficient data extraction

## Data Access

This project requires access to **multiple MIMIC-IV datasets**, all of which are restricted-access resources:

1. **MIMIC-IV v3.1** (Core hospital data): https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/
2. **MIMIC-IV-ECG v1.0** (ECG recordings): https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-ecg/1.0/
3. **MIMIC-IV-ED v2.2** (Emergency department data): https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-ed/2.2/

### Steps to Obtain Access:

1. Complete the CITI "Data or Specimens Only Research" course: https://about.citiprogram.org/
2. Create a PhysioNet account: https://physionet.org/register/
3. Request access to each dataset above (separate applications required)
4. Sign the PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data Use Agreement for each
5. Once approved, proceed to Data Extraction below

**Note:** Approval typically takes a few business days. You must be approved for all three datasets to use this pipeline.

## Data Extraction

### Method 1: Google BigQuery (Recommended)

This project focuses on **patients who have ECG records** in MIMIC-IV. Use these SQL queries in Google BigQuery to extract the relevant subset:

#### 1. Hospital Diagnoses (ICD Codes)
```sql
-- Save as: diagnoses_icd.csv
SELECT
   di.*,
   did.long_title
FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_3_1_hosp.diagnoses_icd` AS di
JOIN `physionet-data.mimiciv_3_1_hosp.d_icd_diagnoses` AS did
   ON di.icd_code = did.icd_code AND di.icd_version = did.icd_version
WHERE di.subject_id IN (
   SELECT DISTINCT subject_id
   FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ecg.machine_measurements`
)
```

#### 2. Hospital Procedures (ICD Codes)
```sql
-- Save as: procedures_icd.csv
SELECT
   pi.*,
   dip.long_title
FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_3_1_hosp.procedures_icd` AS pi
JOIN `physionet-data.mimiciv_3_1_hosp.d_icd_procedures` as dip
   ON pi.icd_code = dip.icd_code AND pi.icd_version = dip.icd_version
WHERE pi.subject_id IN (
   SELECT DISTINCT subject_id
   FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ecg.machine_measurements`
)
```

#### 3. Hospital Admissions
```sql
-- Save as: admissions.csv
SELECT *
FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_3_1_hosp.admissions` AS a
WHERE a.subject_id IN (
   SELECT DISTINCT subject_id
   FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ecg.machine_measurements`
)
```

#### 4. Patient Demographics
```sql
-- Save as: patients.csv
SELECT *
FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_3_1_hosp.patients` AS p
WHERE p.subject_id IN (
   SELECT DISTINCT subject_id
   FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ecg.machine_measurements`
)
```

#### 5. ECG Records
```sql
-- Save as: ecg_records.csv
SELECT *
FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ecg.record_list` AS rl
WHERE rl.subject_id IN (
   SELECT DISTINCT subject_id
   FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ecg.machine_measurements`
)
```

#### 6. ICU Stays
```sql
-- Save as: icustays.csv
SELECT *
FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_3_1_icu.icustays` AS icu
WHERE icu.subject_id IN (
   SELECT DISTINCT subject_id
   FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ecg.machine_measurements`
)
```

#### 7. Emergency Department Diagnoses
```sql
-- Save as: ed_diagnosis.csv
SELECT *
FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ed.diagnosis` AS edd
WHERE edd.subject_id IN (
   SELECT DISTINCT subject_id
   FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ecg.machine_measurements`
)
```

#### 8. Emergency Department Stays
```sql
-- Save as: ed_stays.csv
SELECT *
FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ed.edstays` AS eds
WHERE eds.subject_id IN (
   SELECT DISTINCT subject_id
   FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_ecg.machine_measurements`
)
```

### Data Placement

After running these queries:
1. Export each result as CSV from BigQuery
2. Place all CSV files in the `data/raw/` directory
3. Ensure filenames match those specified in the SQL comments

**Cohort Size:** All queries filter for patients with ECG records, resulting in a subset of the full MIMIC-IV population.

### Method 2: Direct Download

Alternatively, download complete datasets and filter locally:
1. Download each dataset from PhysioNet (links above)
2. Extract relevant CSV files to `data/raw/`
3. The preprocessing pipeline will automatically filter for ECG patients

**Note:** BigQuery is more efficient for large-scale filtering.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ClinicalDigitalTwin.git
cd ClinicalDigitalTwin
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify Data Placement

Ensure all required CSV files are in `data/raw/static` before running preprocessing:
- `diagnoses_icd.csv`
- `drgcodes.csv`
- `procedures_icd.csv`
- `admissions.csv`
- `patients.csv`
- `icustays.csv`
- `ecg_records.csv`
- `ed_diagnosis.csv`
- `ed_stays.csv`
- `record_list.csv`

## Usage

### Running the Preprocessing Pipeline
```bash
python run.py
```

This executes both static and temporal preprocessing according to configuration files in `configs/`:

- **Static preprocessing:** Demographic, comorbidity, and baseline features from admissions and patient data
- **Temporal preprocessing:** Time-series events including ICU vitals, ED visits, procedures, and ECG measurements (**In Progress**)

### Exploratory Analysis

Use the notebooks in `notebooks/` to explore data distributions and quality and test preprocessing functions before running the full pipeline.
